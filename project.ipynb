    "\n",
    "We also need to prevents data leaking so we can't use a methode who use the windows of one session for training AND validation because we have overlapping data in each session, two windows in the same session can share the same datas, and if these two windows are in train and validation, it will lead to data leakage and overly optimistic performance (data in the train set will also be in the validation set). \n",
    "\n",
    "So it's naturally that we have chosen the \"Leave One Group Out\" method, this method will use each session as the validation set once and the other for training. We completly prevent data leakage because each session is indepandent from the other, and we reduce the bias because each session will be used for validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, \"LOGO\" and \"GroupKFold(5)\" produce the same splits, but we choose \"LOGO\" because it's more explicit, readers will immediatly see that we use one session for validation each time while \"GroupKFold\" need to have 5 in parameter to do the same thong"
